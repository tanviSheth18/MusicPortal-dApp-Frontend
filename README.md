Hey everyone! Check out my second deployment of a full stack decentralized application and Ethereum Smart Contract for: Crowdfunding, Escrow Services, Charity Donations, Employee Payroll, StakingÂ Rewards, and Real Estate Investing. 

I've also written a two-part article for a deeper run-through of the code and a detailed explanation of my smart contract and scripts, how I incorporated price feed oracles, optimized for gas, and leveraged unit/staging tests.

Be sure to check out my video, where I dive into all the components of my backend, run through a demo of my frontend, and explain concepts unique to Web3 along the way. This time, I prioritize real-world contexts and explore advanced blockchain tools and frameworks to build something that makes sense for a user and developer to switch to, now that I have the foundation to do so.
